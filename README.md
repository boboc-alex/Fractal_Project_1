# BEE's ADVENTURE

## An Interactive Fractal Exploration Game
Bee's Adventure is a Python-based puzzle game designed to make learning about fractals engaging and interactive.
The game is centered around the Sierpinski Hexagon, where players control a bee, collect honey, and explore the depths of fractals.
The project combines mathematical concepts, recursive logic, and game mechanics to create an educational and entertaining experience.
##Features
###Interactive Gameplay:
Control a bee to navigate through fractal-based levels.
Collect honey scattered across the hexagonal maze.
###Fractal Visualization:
Explore the recursive structure of the Sierpinski Hexagon.
Dynamic color gradients enhance the visual appeal of fractals.
###Dynamic Menus:
A video-enhanced main menu and leveling menu using OpenCV and Tkinter.
###Customization Options:
Zoom in and out of fractals using a slider.
Change fractal colors dynamically.
###Leveling System:
Progress through three increasingly complex levels, each with deeper recursive structures.
###Gamification Elements:
Scoring system based on collected honey.
